## 2026-04-21 — WhatsApp CRM: contacts registry, templates, scoped logs, WA buttons

**Focus:** Full WhatsApp CRM layer — contact registry, template management, send log, WA buttons across all pages, scoped logs per entity

### Done
- `src/models.py` — 3 new tables: `wa_contacts`, `wa_templates`, `wa_template_sends`; 2 new columns on `whatsapp_log`: `entity_type`, `entity_id`; both PG + SQLite migrations
- `src/routes/wa_contacts.py` — NEW: contact registry CRUD + `from-tenant/professional/owner/team` shortcuts; `user_fields` auto-built from entity data; `placeholder-fields` endpoint
- `src/routes/wa_templates.py` — NEW: full template lifecycle (draft→submit Meta→approved); WABA_ID auto-discovery; status sync; send approved templates with positional body params; send log
- `src/app.py` — registered `wa_contacts` + `wa_templates` blueprints; hourly WA report disabled; added 5-min template status sync scheduler job
- `src/routes/whatsapp.py` — `wa_log()` entity_type/entity_id/phone filtering; image model fix (`claude-3-5-haiku-20241022`); `message_body=''` fix for UnboundLocalError
- `index.html` — WhatsApp page: 4-tab layout (Inbox|Contacts|Templates|Send Log); full templates builder + preview; contacts table; send log; Team page WA log removed
- `index.html` — 📲 WA button added: tenants modal, professionals cards + modal, owners modal; `initWaBtn()` + `registerWaContact()` functions
- `index.html` — Scoped WA logs: pro modal shows last 5 messages for that pro's phone; tenant modal shows last 5 for tenant's phone; `loadScopedWaLog()` function

### Context for next session
- WhatsApp permanent system user token: still pending (24h expiry)
- entity_type/entity_id on whatsapp_log INSERT: columns added but not yet populated in webhook handler (phone-based filter works instead)
- UI/UX polish pass: subtle visual improvements (softer shadows, pill badges)

## 2026-04-21 — Auto-sync Monday + paginated logs + no more manual refresh

**Focus:** Remove all manual refresh/sync buttons; everything auto-updates. Paginated log views.

### Done
- `src/app.py` — APScheduler: Monday apartments auto-sync every 30min (`IntervalTrigger`), professionals every 2h, runs on startup
- `src/routes/professionals.py` — Extracted `run_professionals_sync()` as standalone function callable from scheduler without HTTP context
- `src/routes/whatsapp.py` — `wa_log()` pagination: `limit/offset` query params, returns `{messages, total, offset, limit}`
- `src/routes/activity.py` — Activity log pagination: `limit/offset` params, default limit 50 (was 200)
- `index.html` — Removed all manual "Sync Monday.com" and "Refresh" buttons for logs
- `index.html` — WA inbox auto-refreshes every 7s (conversation list + active thread)
- `index.html` — WA log auto-refreshes every 15s via `startWaLogAutoRefresh()` / `stopWaLogAutoRefresh()`
- `index.html` — Activity log auto-refreshes every 30s via `startActivityLogAutoRefresh()` / `stopActivityLogAutoRefresh()`
- `index.html` — Both logs show "Load 50 more" pagination button; `_waLogOffset` / `_actLogOffset` state vars
- `index.html` — `showPage()` starts/stops log auto-refresh on page enter/leave
- `index.html` — Monday sync UI changed: "Force sync" small button + "🔄 auto-syncing" status label
- `index.html` — `apiFetch()` global helper defined (was missing — all modal saves crashed silently)

### Context for next session
- Voice transcription: needs `OPENAI_API_KEY` on Render env vars
- WhatsApp permanent system user token: still pending
- WhatsApp message templates: still pending

## 2026-04-20 — WhatsApp inbox complete — bot takeover, opt-in status, real chat UI

**Focus:** Full WhatsApp inbox: human takeover per contact, opt-in status, WA-style bubbles

### Done
- `src/routes/whatsapp.py` — `/api/whatsapp/conversations` now returns `bot_paused` + `opted_out` per conversation
- `src/routes/whatsapp.py` — `POST /api/whatsapp/conversations/{phone}/bot-pause` — toggle bot silence per contact
- `src/routes/whatsapp.py` — `POST /api/whatsapp/conversations/{phone}/opt-out` — toggle notification opt-out from dashboard
- `src/routes/whatsapp.py` — Webhook checks `wa_bot_paused_{phone}` in system_settings before processing; if paused, message logged but bot stays silent
- `index.html` — Conversation list cards: show 👤 YOU badge when bot paused, 🔕 badge when opted out
- `index.html` — Thread header: bot status badge (🤖 Bot active / 👤 Manual mode) + "Take over" / "Give back to bot" toggle buttons
- `index.html` — Composer: amber border + "You are in control" label when bot is paused
- `index.html` — Messages: 3 distinct bubble styles — incoming (white), bot reply (green tint), dashboard/you (indigo tint)
- `index.html` — Right panel: bot status card + notification status card, both with inline toggle buttons
- `index.html` — `pulse` CSS animation for live dot in conversation list header
- `index.html` — `toggleBotPause()`, `toggleWaOptOut()`, `updateBotPauseUI()`, `renderWaContext()` completely rewritten

## 2026-04-20 — WhatsApp image analysis, voice transcription, auto-refresh

**Focus:** Handle media in WhatsApp; live inbox without pressing refresh

### Done
- `src/routes/whatsapp.py` — Image analysis: download WhatsApp photo → Claude Vision → describe in chat
  - Reply with description + hint: "Чтобы сохранить — напиши: сохрани к квартире [номер]"
  - Follow-up "save to apartment X" → saves file to `database/uploads/` + records in documents table
  - Session stores last image bytes for follow-up save command
- `src/routes/whatsapp.py` — Voice message transcription via OpenAI Whisper (if OPENAI_API_KEY set)
  - Downloads audio → Whisper → transcribed text treated as message → Claude answers
  - Graceful fallback if key not set
- `src/routes/whatsapp.py` — Helper functions: `wa_download_media`, `analyze_image_with_claude`,
  `transcribe_audio_with_whisper`, `save_media_to_apartment`
- `index.html` — WhatsApp inbox auto-refresh every 8s (conversation list + active thread)
  - `startWaAutoRefresh()` / `stopWaAutoRefresh()` — start/stop on page enter/leave
  - No more manual refresh button needed
- `requirements.txt` — Added `openai>=1.0` for Whisper API

### Context for next session
- To enable voice transcription: set `OPENAI_API_KEY` env var on Render
- Image save uses `documents` table with `apartment_id` — will appear in apartment docs section
- WhatsApp templates: still pending

## 2026-04-20 — Permanent data protection + non-destructive Monday sync

**Focus:** Prevent data loss — sync must never delete professionals, logs, commissions, payments

### Done
- `src/monday_sync.py` — Completely rewrote `sync_to_db()`: now UPSERT by monday_id (stored in apartment notes JSON), never deletes anything
  - Apartments: matched by `monday_id` in notes → UPDATE status/rent; INSERT if new
  - Leases: UPDATE rent_amount + dates only; commission settings (type/value/payment_day) preserved forever
  - Tenants: placeholder only created when no active lease exists; never deleted
  - NEVER touched: professionals, professional_payments, whatsapp_log, activity_log, notification_prefs, app_users, team_members, payments
- `src/models.py` — Added `team_members` table to SQLite safe_migrate (was only in PG path)
- `index.html` — Sync button now shows breakdown: "✓ N apts (X new, Y updated)"
- `index.html` — Fixed professionals sync alert to show `imported`/`skipped` (was wrongly showing `updated`)

### Context for next session
- Professionals sync from Monday is already built at `POST /api/professionals/sync-monday` — safe, UPSERT by monday_id, preserves manual edits
- Main sync (`POST /api/sync`) is now fully safe to run without data loss
- WhatsApp image analysis + voice message transcription: David requested — not yet built
- WhatsApp templates: still pending (after notifications system, per David)

## 2026-04-19 23:11 — WhatsApp Inbox built
- Added GET /api/whatsapp/conversations (conversation list grouped by phone)
- Added GET /api/whatsapp/conversations/<phone> (thread)
- Added POST /api/whatsapp/send (dashboard send)
- Added WhatsApp Inbox page: 3-panel UI (conversations, chat thread, context)
- Added 💬 WhatsApp nav item

---

## Session 1 — 2026-04-01

**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Phase:** Phase 0 → Phase 1 start
**Focus:** Project setup, requirements gathering, and MVP dashboard UI design

### Done
- Extracted and ran ProjectOS v3.3.0 create-project.sh to scaffold project
- Created GitHub repo (care-prog/Apartment-management-Odessa)
- Generated SSH key, added to GitHub, pushed initial commit
- Installed Claude in Chrome extension for browser automation
- Analyzed 5 WhatsApp audio transcripts (Russian) from departing supervisor Katya
- Analyzed Hebrew task matrix spreadsheet mapping responsibilities across Anya, Alina, and Katya
- Confirmed requirements with David: web + mobile, all-in-one dashboard MVP
- Designed complete MVP dashboard UI (index.html) with all 8 sections
- Preserved original ProjectOS dashboard as project-dashboard.html
- Filled in all project docs: PROJECT_BRIEF, TASK_PIPELINE, TECH_STACK, DATA_STRUCTURE

### Decisions Made
- Web + Mobile (PWA): Both platforms, responsive design with installable PWA — David confirmed
- All-in-one dashboard: MVP covers all modules with basic functionality — David confirmed
- Tech stack: Python/Flask + SQLite + vanilla HTML/CSS/JS — lightweight, no framework lock-in
- Keep both dashboards: project-dashboard.html (dev tracking) + index.html (actual app)
- Property data: 7 properties, 19 apartments, 16 occupied, 3 vacant — from Katya's transcripts

### Problems
- No brew/gh CLI installed — created repo manually via browser
- SSH keys not configured — generated new ED25519 key, added via Chrome extension
- Chrome extension not initially connected — user installed it mid-session

### Current State
```
Phase: 1 (MVP Core)
Tasks done this phase: 6 of 14
Overall progress: 40%
App currently: Full dashboard with Flask API, SQLite DB (13 tables), Monday.com sync (33 items), real property data
Not working yet: Vercel deployment, CRUD forms, document upload, automated notifications
Server runs at: http://localhost:5050
```

### Next Steps
1. Deploy to Vercel (need to convert to serverless + cloud DB)
2. Add password protection (David-only access)
3. Add CRUD forms for adding/editing tenants, payments, tasks
4. Connect Monday.com real-time webhook (auto-sync on changes)
5. Fix Sofievskaya showing $100,000 rent (that's the sale price, not rent)

### Open Questions
- Vercel deployment: needs serverless rewrite + cloud DB (Turso/Supabase) — confirmed by David
- Split app data migration: still open
- Some Monday.com items have no status/rent (Pushkinskaya individual flats, Kladovka, etc.) — need clarification

---

## 2026-04-20 — Fix: PostgreSQL sync CASE WHEN NULL type error

**Focus:** Fix `sync_to_db` crash on PostgreSQL production

### Done
- `src/monday_sync.py` — Replaced `CASE WHEN ? IS NOT NULL THEN ? ELSE col END` pattern with dynamic Python-side UPDATE builder
  - PostgreSQL can't infer the type of a `NULL` parameter in `CASE WHEN %s IS NOT NULL`
  - Fix: build SET clause string dynamically in Python, only adding date columns when values are non-None
- Triggered manual Render deploy (bf80ef7) — confirmed sync now works in production
- Verified bot-pause endpoint live at `POST /api/whatsapp/conversations/{phone}/bot-pause`


## 2026-04-20 — Architecture: per-apartment owner (apartments.owner_id)

**Focus:** Tower Chekalov has multiple investors. Each apartment is independently owned.

### Problem
`owner_id` was only at the `properties` (building) level. All apartments in Tower Chekalov were forced to share one owner. David needs to assign individual apartments to different owners.

### Design decision
- `properties.owner_id` = building-level default / administrative grouping (unchanged)
- `apartments.owner_id` = TRUE ownership — this is now the source of truth
- Backfill: existing apartments get `owner_id` copied from their property
- New apartments inherit from property as default, but can be overridden per-apartment

### Done
- `src/models.py` — safe_migrate: `ALTER TABLE apartments ADD COLUMN owner_id`; backfill from property
- `src/routes/properties.py` — apartments CRUD now reads/writes `owner_id`; `GET /api/apartments` includes `owner_name`; new `POST /api/apartments/{id}/reassign` endpoint; `owner_detail` now aggregates by `apartment.owner_id` (not property)
- `src/routes/finance.py` — `owners_financial_summary` now queries `WHERE apartments.owner_id = X`; shows apartments grouped by building (not properties list)
- `src/monday_sync.py` — new apartments inherit property's `owner_id` at creation
- `index.html` — apartment edit modal: owner dropdown (populated from `/api/owners`)
- `index.html` — property modal apartments table: Owner column per row with colored badge
- `index.html` — finance owner cards: shows "Apartments owned" grouped by building

### Impact
- Financial reports now correctly attribute income per apartment owner
- Owner cards show which apartments (in which buildings) they own
- Can reassign Tower Chekalov apt 138 from David to Investor B without touching other apts
